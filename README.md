# AI Toolkit

A personal library of reusable AI templates, prompts, custom agents, and workflows to accelerate AI-assisted development.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized collection of AI resources that can be quickly integrated into any project. Rather than recreating prompts and configurations from scratch, clone this repo into your project's `_ai` directory and reference, use, copy, or customize the resources as needed.

## Usage

### Adding to a Project

1. Clone this repository into your project as `_ai`:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> _ai
   ```

2. The included `.gitignore` file ensures the `_ai` directory won't be committed to your project repository.

3. Reference or copy resources from `_ai` into your project as needed.

### Workflow

- **Reference**: Link to templates and prompts directly from the `_ai` directory
- **Use**: Apply custom agents and configurations as-is
- **Copy**: Duplicate resources into your project for one-time use
- **Customize**: Modify copies for project-specific requirements

## Structure

Organize your resources by type:

- `/prompts` - Reusable prompt templates
- `/agents` - Custom agent configurations
- `/templates` - Code and documentation templates
- `/workflows` - Common AI-assisted workflows

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Maintain standardized AI interactions across projects
- **Speed**: Skip setup time by reusing proven resources
- **Evolution**: Continuously improve your AI toolkit in one place
- **Portability**: Easily bring your AI tools to any new project

## Maintenance

Keep this repository updated with new resources and improvements discovered during project work. Better prompts and workflows benefit all future projects.
