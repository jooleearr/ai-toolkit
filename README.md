---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a **centralized collection** of AI resources that can be quickly integrated into any project. Rather than recreating prompts and configurations from scratch, clone this repo into your project's `_ai` directory and reference, use, copy, or customize the resources as needed.

## 🚀 Usage

### Adding to a Project

**1.** Clone this repository into your project as `_ai`:
```bash
git clone <repository-url> _ai
